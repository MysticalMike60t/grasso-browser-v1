# Grasso Browser Alpha

This project is an **experimental** browser UI that runs as a Google Chrome app
and uses webview tags. It's in its **very early** stages at the moment.

## Key Features

* A tree structure for managing your tabs (that you can choose to hide).
* No distinction between bookmarks and tabs.
* Ability to rename tabs.
* Ability to "pin" tabs to prevent accidentally navigating away / closing.
* Not all tabs need to be loaded at once (they are loaded when you want them to
  be, and marked with a tick. You can also unload tabs to free up memory
  without fully closing them).
* Ability to colour-code tabs.

## Immidiate TODOs

* Allow closing of tabs with subtabs (pick between close / keep children)

## Roadmap

* Settings Screen.
* Ability to move tabs around.
* Touch-Screen friendly interactivity for managing tabs.
* Allow creation of different users, and switching users for particular tabs.
  (This could for example allow you to log in to certain sites with different
  users at the same time).
* Syncing tabs accross computers.
* Plugin architecture.
